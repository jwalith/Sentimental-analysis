Sentimental Analysis On Flight Reviews(Virgin America And United Airlines) Based On The Passengers Flying Experience 
The problem in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level  Sentiment Analysis to determine the attitude of the mass is positive, negative or neutral towards the subject of interest.

In this project, we have proposed methods for Segregating the Passenger Reviews Based on Their Flying Experience. The Feedback Is A Binary Classification which Has Only 2 Values Either Positive Or Negative. This model can be used by the airlines companies to provide a better flying experience for their passengers
