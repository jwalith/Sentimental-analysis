This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis** tool for flight reviews, allowing users to classify feedback as either positive ("Good Review") or negative ("Bad Review") On Flight Reviews(Virgin America And United Airlines) Based On The Passengers Flying Experience . The analysis is powered by a trained machine learning model and features a GUI for user interaction.

## Features

- **Sentiment Prediction**: Classifies flight reviews into positive or negative categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: GUI built using Tkinter for input and prediction display.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes a pre-trained model for robust sentiment analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
   - Run the cells to load the necessary libraries and start the application.

2. **Enter Text for Prediction**:
